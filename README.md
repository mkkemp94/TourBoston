# TourBoston

Done as a project for Udemy Course https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud839/lessons/6745394898239847/concepts/78297108220923# with the prompt "create a tour guide app".

This project is based off of chrisbanes' Cheesesquare app, but instead of presenting different types of cheeses it showcases some of the sites in Boston that I frequently visit, including stops for food, schools, and other places to visit. Some of the programming concpts explored through this app are as followed:

Fragments
View Pager
Tabbed navigation
Parent activities
Intents to email/social apps
Collapsing Toolbar
FloatingActionButton
View anchoring
NavigationView
